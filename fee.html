<p>Sri Chaitanya Techno School is Offering Very Less fee to all Students. We dont take money from Merti Students ...cam in Andhra Pradesh by the Sri Chaitanya Educational Group [1]. Since its inception in the mid-80s, the group has been promoting rote learning under the pretext of revolutionizing education in the then state of Andhra Pradesh. Over the years, it has evolved into a behemoth of hundreds of sub organizations that mistreat students, harass them with archaic practices and subject them to unreasonable amounts of stress. Alongside Narayana, its chief competitor, Sri Chaitanya has been running a crippling duopoly in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana leading to the highest percentage of student suicides, among children aged between 12–18 since the early 1900s.[2]</p>

<p>Sri Chaitanya started in 1986 with a girls' junior college in Vijayawada.[3] Sri Chaitanya Techno School (also called SCTS) was opened in Eluru in June 2010 on the Santhinagar Main road. It has 1006 students studying from kindergarten to 10th class in main branch and other 570 members in 1 town branch. It operates bus services to all parts of the city. It is also known as Chaitanya school main branch in West Godavari district. It is one of the worst institutes in India. There is no quality education. Hostels lack cleanliness, poor facilities and hygiene.</p>
